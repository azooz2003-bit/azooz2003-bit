Hey! My name is Aziz, and I'm an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech, pursuing a Computer Science degree. 
Residing in Atlanta, from Kuwait.

So a bit about myself...

I generally love building, especially whenever I learn something new.
Whenever I feel the need to relax or go out I'll opt for volleyball/gym.
For the near future, I really want to concentrate on iOS Development, Algorithmic Design, full-stack development, and some subfield of AI. I plan on deploying them together to create some 
fun projects.

If anyone would like to collaborate or contact me regarding general purposes, please use the following email:

Thank you for reading!
