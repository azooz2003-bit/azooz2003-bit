Hey reader! My name is Aziz, and I'm a current undergraduate student at Georgia Tech, pursuing a Computer Science degree. 
Currently residing in Atlanta, having come all the way from Kuwait.

So a bit about myself...

I generally love coding, especially whenever I learn something new, there's always this buzz feeling you know.
I'm a weeb, so anime's are mostly what I watch, my favourite's One Piece, I'm up to date on the manga. Whenever I feel the need to destress I'll opt for volleyball.
Enough fun stuff about me. For the future, I really want to concentrate on Machine Learning and App Development. I plan on deploying them together to create some 
fun projects, the thought alone excites me!

If anyone would like to collaborate or contact me regarding general purposes, please use the following email:

Thank you for reading.
