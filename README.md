Hey! My name is Aziz, and I'm a current undergraduate student at Georgia Tech, pursuing a Computer Science degree. 
Currently residing in Atlanta, having come all the way from Kuwait.

So a bit about myself...

I generally love coding, especially whenever I learn something new.
Whenever I feel the need to relax or go out I'll opt for volleyball.
Enough fun stuff about me. For the future, I really want to concentrate on Machine Learning and App Development. I plan on deploying them together to create some 
fun projects.

If anyone would like to collaborate or contact me regarding general purposes, please use the following email:

Thank you for reading!
