Hey! My name is Aziz, and I'm pursuing a BS in CS at Georgia Tech. 
Based in Atlanta.

So a bit about myself...

I really enjoy iOS development, algorithms. I want to do more low-level computer networks, and perhaps backend eng. in the future.
To enjoy myself, I'll opt for volleyball.

If anyone would like to collaborate or contact me, please use the following email:

Thank you for reading!
